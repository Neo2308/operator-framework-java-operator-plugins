# Java Operator SDK

## Overview

This project is a component of the [Operator Framework][of-home], an
open source toolkit to manage Kubernetes native applications, called
Operators, in an effective, automated, and scalable way. Read more in
the [introduction blog post][of-blog].

[Operators][operator-link] make it easy to manage complex stateful
applications on top of Kubernetes. However writing an operator today can
be difficult because of challenges such as using low level APIs, writing
boilerplate, and a lack of modularity which leads to duplication.
